# App Development with Swift

&nbsp; &nbsp; Guided projects and labs included in Apple's [App Development With Swift](https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996) book

&nbsp; &nbsp; Ch.1 - Ch.3 not included

&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: I have gone beyond the requirements/expectations for the majority of these projects, which is why many of them may not appear or function exactly as they do in the book.

## Guided Projects (Ch.4 - Ch.6)

### Restaurant 

An interactive menu for a restaurant that allows the customer to view a list of offerings, add items to an order, and submit the order to the restaurant. Using a server that you'll run on your own computer, you'll have an opportunity to modify the options, descriptions, and images that are returned from the API.
