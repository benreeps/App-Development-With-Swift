## Guided Project 
### ToDo List (XCode Themed)

#### Functionality 
A simple app that works as a todo list. The user can create a new task by tapping the "+" bar button item in the top right corner of the display, assign a due date/time, add task notes and have all tasks conveniently displayed in a tableview that closely resembles XCode's layout in dark mode. If the orange breakpoint to the left of the task is tapped, the task can be considered as complete and the color of the breakpoint will change to green. The user can delete a task by swiping to the left and selecting delete or by selecting the "edit" bar button in the top left corner of the display. Tapping on the cell of a previously created task will direct the user back to the editing screen where they can make and save changes to any of the information they had previously saved.
